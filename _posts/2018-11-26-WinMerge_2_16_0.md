[WinMerge](https://winmerge.org/) 2.16.0 has been released. WinMerge is my favorite open source differencing/merging tool for Windows. This release has been a long time coming–the previous stable release, 2.14.0, came out in February 2013. The download page is at [https://winmerge.org/downloads/](https://winmerge.org/downloads/).

The new release has some nice enhancements, including 3-way file comparison and a 64-bit version. I encourage you to give it a try. (I’m not associated in any way with the WinMerge project, but I find it to be an indispensible tool.)

Enjoy!
